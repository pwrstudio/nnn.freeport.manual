## Post types

There are three different types of posts: **Exhibition**, **Work** and **Content**.

An exhibition can contain works, which in turn contain content, i.e.:

```
Exhibition
    => Work
        => Content
```

You connect work posts in in the _Works_ field at the bottom of the exhibition post.

You connect content posts in the _Content_ field at the bottom of the work post.

Content posts can be of the type:

- Image
- Text
- Video
- Audio
- External link
- File

One piece of content per post. You select the type in the _Main_ tab and add the media file, or text, under the corresponding tab.

## Publishing

To publish a post, first [save it](https://i.imgur.com/esld935.png).

Then [publish](https://i.imgur.com/KG9OX3g.png).

It will take a few minutes for the content to show up on the website,as it needs to be uploaded to IPFS etc...

Also note that work posts that are not connected to an exhibition will not show up on the website, likewise for content that is not connected with a work post.
